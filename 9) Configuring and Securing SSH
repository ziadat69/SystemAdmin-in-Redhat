1) Use the ssh-keygen command to generate passphrase-less SSH keys in server a

  ==> ssh-keygen

2) Use the ssh-copy-id command to send the public key of the SSH key pair 

  ==> ssh-copy-id ziadat69@serverb

3) Confirm that ziadat69 can successfully log in to serverb using the SSH keys.

   ===> ssh ziadt69@serverb

4) Set PermitRootLogin to no in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and reload sshd. You may use vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config to edit the configuration file of sshd.

   ===> vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
  
      PasswordAuthentication no

   ===> systemctl reload sshd

 • The ssh command allows users to access remote systems securely using the SSH protocol.
 • A client system stores remote servers' identities in ~/.ssh/known_hosts and /etc/ssh/ ssh_known_hosts.
 • SSH supports both password-based and key-based authentication.
 • The ssh-keygen command generates an SSH key pair for authentication. The ssh-copy-id command exports the public key to remote systems.
 • The sshd service implements the SSH protocol on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.
 • It is a recommended practice to configure sshd to disable remote logins as root and to require
  public key authentication rather than password-based authentication.
