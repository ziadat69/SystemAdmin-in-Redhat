1) Redirect a long listing of all content in the student's home directory, including hidden directories and files, into a file named editing_final_lab.txt.

        ===> cd 
        ===> ls -al > editing_final_lab.txt

2) Edit the file using Vim.

         ==> vim editing_final_lab.txt

3) Remove the first three lines. Enter line-based visual mode with uppercase V.

     ==> Shift+V ==> down arrow key  ==> x

4)  Use the :wq command to save and exit the file. Make a backup, using the date (in seconds) to
    create a unique file name.

      ==> Exit key ==> wq 
      ===> editing_final_lab_$(date +%s).txt

5)   Append a directory listing of the Documents directory. List the directory listing on the terminal and send it to the editing_final_lab.txt file with one command line.

        ===> ls Documents/ | tee -a editing_final_lab.txt

6) Confirm that the directory listing is at the bottom of the lab file.
      ===>   cat editing_final_lab.txt
