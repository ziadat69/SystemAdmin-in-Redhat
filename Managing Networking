1) Determine the interface name and the current active connection's name. 
    ==> ip link 

2)Create the new lab connection profile based on the information in the table described in the instructions.

   ==> nmcli con add con-name ziadat69 ifname ens3 type ethernet ip4 172.30.312.4/24 gw4 172.30.312.254
   ==> nmcli con mod "lab" ipv4.dns 172.30.312.4

3) Modify the new connection so that it also uses the address 10.0.1.1/24..
    ==> nmcli con mod "ziadat69" +ipv4.addresses 10.0.1.1/24

4) Configure the hosts file so that 10.0.1.1 can be referenced as private.
   ==> echo "10.0.1.1 private" >> /etc/hosts

5)  Display the current host name.
   ==> hostname

6)Bring up the connection with the new settings. 
   ==> nmcli con up "ens3"

7) Test connectivity using the new network addresses.
   ping -c5 10.0.1.1



• The TCP/IP network model is a simplified,
four-layered set of abstractions that describes how different protocols interoperate in order for computers to send traffic from one machine to another over the Internet.
• IPv4 is the primary network protocol used on the Internet today. IPv6 is intended as an eventual replacement for the IPv4 network protocol. 
By default, 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operates in dual-stack mode, using both protocols in parallel.
• NetworkManager is a daemon that monitors and manages network configuration.
• The nmcli command is a command-line tool for configuring network settings with NetworkManager.
• The system's static host name is stored in the /etc/hostname file. The hostnamectl command is used to modify or view the status of the system's host name and related settings. 
The hostname command displays or temporarily modifies the system's host name.
