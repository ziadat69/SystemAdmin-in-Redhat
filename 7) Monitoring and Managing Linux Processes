1) Create a script called process1, which will generate artificial CPU load. 

     ===> vim process1
          while true; do
    echo "Generating artificial CPU load..."
    # Perform a task that generates CPU load
    # For example, calculate the sum of squares
    for i in {1..100000}; do
        echo "$i^2" | bc >/dev/null &
    done
    wait
    sleep 1  # Adjust sleep duration as needed
     done

2) In the right window, run the top utility.
    ==> top

3) Start the process1 process in the background.
   process1 &

4) In the left terminal shell use the lscpu command to determine the number of logical CPUs on this virtual machine.
         lscpu

5) In the left terminal shell run the ps command with the jT to view the remaining jobs.
  ==> ps jT




• A process is a running instance of an executable program. Processes are assigned a state, which
can be running, sleeping, stopped, or zombie. The ps command is used to list processes.
• Each terminal is its own session and can have foreground process and independent background
processes. The jobs command displays processes within a terminal session.
• A signal is a software interrupt that reports events to an executing program. The kill, pkill,
and killall commands use signals to control processes.
• Load average is an estimate of how busy the system is. To display load average values, you can
use the top, uptime, or w command.
